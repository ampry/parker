This call may be recorded for quality assurance. If you wish to take the one-question survey at the end of this call, please stay on the line after. This call is being recorded. Hi. Thank you for calling Trajector Medical. This is Jessica. How can I help you? Hi. This is Michael, and I have Mr. Rashad on the line regarding their interest in VA disability benefits. Thank you, and both of you have a great day. All right. Hello. Can you hear me? Yeah, I can hear you. Hi. This is Jessica with Trajector Medical. Am I speaking with Rashad? Yes, this is him. All right. So, Rashad, let me inform you that this call is being recorded for quality and training purposes as well as compliance with the federal law. So, Rashad, you already talked with one of the representatives here, right, in Trajector, and you got disconnected from her? Yeah, I did. But, yeah, the other guy, he reconnected, and he said that I qualify. Okay. So, one moment. Let me just check if that representative is available now. Okay? Hold on. Okay. All right. All right. I'll be connecting you over now to that representative. Okay? Thank you. All right. Thank you. This call is being recorded. Up on the armrest, my left arm. Lift it up. Lift it on my elbow. What? Up on my left arm. Lift it up. I'm just kind of going to do this. All right. What is your name,'s name, please, and your email address, please? Lift it up. Lift it on my elbow. Put my elbow on. All right. Yeah, sorry about that. I'm here. Okay, no worries. Don't worry. So, yeah, before I get into that, I was District Attorney Gregory, correct? Yes, ma'am. Perfect. So before the phone went out, I was going to talk about our fees. So we do charge for our services, but it's only if we're able to help you get an increase. So if you get denied or you choose to cancel, there's no fee whatsoever. That's not up to you to start the process either. But let's just say you do get 10%. Our fee is five times whatever the VA grant you as a one-time fee at the end. But if you do get 10%, which is around $100 a month, our fee will be a one-time fee of $500. But let's just say if you do get around 40%, which is around $800 a month, it could be a one-time fee of $4,000. So it can be a lot higher or lower. It just depends on what the VA grant you. But we don't ask you to pay on that until you start getting paid from the VA. Okay. Okay? Okay. Do you have any questions on that at all? No, no. You want to go ahead and get started to see what we can do for you? Yeah. Okay. So also, too, at the end of this call, I'm going to be emailing you over an agreement to sign. Once we get that signed, since you never filed before, if there is a nurse available, we can go ahead and get you transferred over to the nurse. So you can go ahead and get that call out the way. After that nurse call, we'll go ahead and start developing the medical evidence packet for you, which can typically take about a week before it's ready to be submitted to the VA. So typically, you need that nurse call out the way. It does help with the process a lot faster. So just give me one moment here. Do you have, like, an honorable or an honorable discharge? Honorable discharge. Honorable medical discharge. Okay. Honorable medical. All right. So I'm just going to go through some qualifying questions first just to see if you qualify. Is your email address Rashad-Gregory47-yahoo.com? Yes, ma'am. Okay. And are you getting any VA attention at all? A pension? Yes. Are you getting a VA pension? No, I'm not getting anything. A VA pension? Okay. I'm getting disabilities. That's it. Okay. Perfect. Perfect. And the VA recognizes your first and last name as Rashad-Gregory? Yes. Rashad. Rashad. Oh, Rashad. Okay. Got you. Rashad. Rashad. Sorry. Rashad. It's like K-I-N-A-T-L. Rashad! They got your brother! That's me. That's me. I'm Rashad. Okay. What's your date of birth? My date of birth is February 16, 1994. 1994, February 16. Perfect. All right. And let's see here. All right. So, also, too, if we determine that we're able to assist you further, I will need to collect some personal information, such as your race and social security number. We only collect and process this information in order to provide our services to you. You can share information with anyone without your express consent to do so, and you can also access our privacy policy at trajector.com slash privacy. Please say agree if you consent to us processing this information only for the purposes of providing our services. Please. I'll consent. I consent, yes. What was that? Oh, you asked for my consent? Yes, if you're okay with that. Yeah, I'm okay. Okay. All right. And what state do you currently live in? Arizona. Okay. All right. And you're not currently getting any assistance at the moment? No. All right. And just let you know that we are not the VA, and we do not represent you on your claims, and we do not prepare your claims for the VA disability payments. Okay? Okay. Well, I get, like, the paperwork and stuff for it, so I need to prove it. Yes. That pretty much means that we're not the VA, and we're not lawyers or attorneys. We're just simply a third-party company who builds up that medical package for you, so you don't have to do that part, and all you do is submit it to the VA. Okay. Yes, sir. And do you have, like, a VA.gov or eBenefits account? I think I do, but I don't remember the info on it. I would have to double-check. Okay. I'm not sure. All right. No worries. If you haven't, you just might have to reset your password, because it is, like, a – if you haven't logged in for a long time, it's had you do, like, some identity stuff. So no worries here. Have you ever filed before an open or pending claim? And when were you discharged from active duty? Let me see if I can get this. I joined – I want to say 2014, 2015. Okay. What was the month? Your best guess is good, at least, or the season, if you're not sure. June. June 20, 2014. All right. June 20. And you did at least 90 days of active duty? What did you say? Did you do at least 90 days of active duty? Yeah. Okay. Perfect. And your – it says active duty National Guard. And you say you're medically honorable. All right. And then what four-digit PIN code would you like to use to verify your identity? A thick one? Yes, like one – because we're going to use this as your identification whenever we call you, for you to confirm. Okay. 9641. 9641. All right. So I already went over the different options that you can take to file disability benefits. So now we're going to go ahead and jump into the medical intake. All right. And what branch were you discharged from? Army National Guard. Army National Guard. All right. And what base were you discharged from? I have to look it up because they tell me if you get the name all the time. Hold on one second. Okay. Hold on one second. Okay. Sorry, it's taking me a minute. Hold on. Oh, no, you're fine. You're fine. I'm just getting some things done. But you're fine. Okay. And just let me know if you do need any help. I typically just put in, like, the branch and then, like, the city and the state, and then it typically will pop up for me. Just let me know if you need any help. Okay. Yeah, I need help. Okay. Yeah. Arizona, Phoenix, and what else did you need? What other places? So what pops up for me was Arizona National Guard, Pago Park, Phoenix MEPS. Yeah, that's correct. Phoenix MEPS. Yeah, Pago Park, yeah. Yeah, that's right. Oh, Pago. You said, so is the Arizona National Guard Pago Park? Yeah. Okay. One moment here. Let me get that in. All right. And did you ever see, like, a severance pay where they pay you to leave the military early? Yeah, they gave me a payment for staying in the hospital. They gave me a benefit because I was in the hospital for four months. So I had a benefit from that. I had a benefit from that. That sounds like medical benefits. Go ahead. Yeah, that was the medical benefits. Okay. So, yeah, so severance is, like, if there's, like, too many people in the military, they kind of pay you to kind of, like, leave a little bit early, and sometimes you end up having to pay back, like, later on in life. Oh, yeah. No, it wasn't like that. They was begging for me to do this. I never even, people, I never heard that. I never heard of too many people in the Army. You can't never have too big of an Army, just in case. Well, you want to have that Army. That's why we get to live with freedom. Right. Yeah, it's like a, yeah, the exact definition of it is, let me see here. One moment. So severance pay is pretty much to employees who are involuntarily separated from the federal services and meet specific eligibility requirements. So I believe, like, at one point they were paying people to, like, if you were to leave, you know, they'll pay you, like, a certain amount of money, but you end up having to pay back that money that they didn't tell a lot of military veterans about. So they start trying to file for disability benefits instead of paying that back. Also, I was told before that because I was in military service, that I have land somewhere, like, I own land somewhere. So that would be something you might have to ask specifically the VA about. Because, like, we just, honestly, we just help with getting veterans paid for their disabilities, and that's pretty much it. So definitely just reach out, because I'm just knowing that the VA.gov, that is a great resource for things that veterans are eligible for or that they can get assistance with. I would definitely say reach out to that website or just call the VA to see. That would be great if that was the case. Yeah, no, I'm going to the VA on Wednesday. So, yeah, no, I'm going to get that figured out. Okay, yeah, for sure, definitely. All righty. So those separate there. And then what conditions do you have that you're looking to get benefits for? What conditions? Yes. Incomplete quadriplegia. That's the name of the diagnosis. Incomplete quadriplegia. Incomplete quad. Incomplete quadriplegia. And the injury I suffered was called occipital dislocation. And I fractured my top three vertebrae in my spine, my C1 to C3. Okay, and that was their national guard? Yes. With your back? Okay. And the incomplete quadriplegia, is that in your back as well? Yeah, it's in my back already. Is that in your back, like where that area is? Is that in your back or just a body part? My neck, it's my neck. Oh, it's your neck. So let me put your neck on here. Did that happen also during active duty? I mean during national guard? No, no, it was off duty. It was off duty. It wasn't active duty. Okay, off duty. Okay, so I'm putting here your neck and your back. All right, I'm going to make sure. Thank you. You're welcome. All right, you're a first-time client with us. Will you refer to us by any chance? Yes. Okay, what was the name? I just found you online. Oh, online, okay. All right, let's see here. And are you currently in any trade school? No, I am about to start training for the Special Olympics, though. Okay, awesome. Sounds like it's going to be fun. Are you currently employed and working? I am, like, I do sit-down comedy also for Handicapable, representing the Handicapable because I'm an advocate, I'm a disability advocate, so I'm going to start a podcast, too. I also do open-mic comedy stand-up skits and crowd work and stuff like that. Okay. Is that something that you do, like, that you're trying to get paid under the table for, or is that, like, you're currently, like, employed, like, taxable? I haven't made any profit from it yet. I've literally only done one open mic so far. But I have. Okay. It is with talent agencies with modeling and acting and voice acting. Okay. So you would consider that as being employed, or is that something like kind of like a? Oh, I don't make any money from it right now. I'm just trying to. But you are legally employed doing that? No, I'm not. I'm not under contract or nothing. Oh, okay, gotcha. So I just. Yeah, I'm still auditioning and shit. Sorry. Gotcha, gotcha. Okay, so I'll just say, so I'll just say no as far as currently employed and working, because pretty much that question means, like, you're employed to a company and making, like, a salary. Yeah, I'm still training. Like, I'm about to start training. Like, I'm not even in training yet. I'm about to start training. Hey, I got to go to the doctor's appointment with my primary care today to get checked up and make sure I'm good to make sure I can do it. Then I'm going to go to VA Wednesday. We'll see what the benefits there. Then I got to go to Social Security. Yeah, I got a bunch of shit to do. You know what I mean? But, yeah, no, this is just the start of it, though. But I don't have a job. I haven't worked in over a decade. Okay, okay. Do you feel like you're unable to work, or do you feel like you're work restricted due to your disabilities? Yeah, my disability, because, well, one, I couldn't do the things I wanted to do because I had two disabilities at first. Because spinal cord injury is a deteriorating condition. So you deteriorate, your body deteriorates at an accelerated rate. But it's not, like, you know, it's like you're getting older faster, basically, in a nutshell. Like your body's older, but you're young. Like I'm only 30, but, you know, I live like, you know, I'm 60. Or not even 60, like 92. Gotcha. But, you know, I got mistaken for somebody's granddaddy twice. And the person I was with, they thought my older brother was my son. I was like, nah, nah, something got to give. Something got to give now. Something got to give. That's why I need to make a change. I had my beard out and everything. I was like, yeah, I look older. I was like, now I look 22. That's what I was told. So I look younger without the beard. So I was like, yeah. But I miss my beard, though. I do like the beard. Anyway, I'm rambling. You're fine, you're fine. I want to say, yeah, the beard definitely makes anyone look older and mature. Yeah, yeah. Thank you. Okay. I can grow my hair out. I know I heard you. What was that? I'm going to wait until playoffs. When I start playing. I'm going to do wheelchair football. Okay. So. Okay. Yeah, they have special Olympics wheelchair football. I'm going to go for gold in that. A couple gold medals. Okay, okay. That's cool. Definitely, definitely stay active for sure. I know you said you haven't worked at all in the last ten years. And I know you had mentioned something about the VA. So typically you can still go through. You can work with different companies as far as if it's like a free company like the VA. It's just that if you do end up going through the VA on things that we can't help you with, you can definitely do that. But it's just that you can't work with two different companies for the same conditions. So I just do want to go ahead and let you know that for sure. But you can definitely go through the VA for like, I know we don't really touch on eyes or eyes or like dental. But I do know the VA, if you have any conditions with those or anything like that, they can definitely help you with that also. Okay. Okay. All right. And then what was your MOS in the military? My MOS in the military was 91 Charlie. 91 Charlie. Never going to forget that, bro. That was a dream right there for a second. Not my plan, right? Yep. God's plan. And then what was your, did you do any like parachute jumps at all? No, I was an Army Ranger. I was an Army Ranger. So I thought about it before I was going to do it, because I was going to go active. But then I got in, you know, I got my parachute. Okay. And then are you currently getting any medical retirement pay or any military retirement pay? Medical retirement pay? No, no. I haven't even worked on my retirement yet. Okay. And then were you ever exposed in the military? Were you ever exposed to any Agent Orange, Contaminated Orange, Camp Lejeune, asbestos, or any mustard gas? Yeah, mustard gas. In training, yeah, they used mustard gas. Okay. And that was at, let me see here. That was at the Aragon National Guard base, or was it? No, that was the basic training at Fort Lee, Fort Lee in South Carolina. Fort Lee, L-E-E? Yes. Okay. And your best guess, even though I know it was probably a couple of weeks, what year did you enter the military, to where you were in basic training for that? What year did I enter? I signed up 2012, or before 2012. I signed up in 2011. Yeah, so I signed up in 2011 and got into 2012. So, yeah, that's what it was. I served two and a half years. So I signed, yeah. I signed in 2011. And in 2013 I got in. So I probably got discharged in 2013, too. But it wasn't June 28th. It was like, I don't know, maybe like two or three months after that. All right. So the mustard gas, were you exposed to like any tear gas? Was that like the mustard gas, or was the mustard gas something different? The mustard gas. No, the mustard gas was just basic training. Okay. So you went in, like, because we do have to get, because we ask these days to see, like, the longevity of when you were exposed to those chemicals. So it doesn't have to be, like, spot on. But do you know, like, a month in the year when you're exposed to the mustard gas? Oh, within a month of the year? Like after, or have I been exposed to it? Yeah, like the month in the year when you entered exposure and when you left exposure. So I guess when you got into basic training and then when you left basic training. Or what those dates. That was in 2012. 2012. 2012. Do you know what month that was in 2012? Like it was, like, what season? July. Oh, July of 2012. Or gas or something like that. And then do you know how long you were exposed to the mustard gas? A couple of weeks. No, no, no. It was, like, a couple of seconds. Yeah, like two, three seconds. Oh, okay. So it was just, okay. Okay. So I'm going to add that note on here. I'm just not going to mark it since you were only exposed to it for a couple of seconds. But I am going to add it on here as a note that we kind of talk about that a little bit more with the nurse to see if there's any possible respiratory pains or anything like that. Okay. But when everybody gets mustard gas, like, it's a basic training thing. It's a part of the test. I mean, it's part of the training. Training course. You know what I'm saying? Yeah, but, okay, yeah, if you have to take a note of it, you can take a note of it. Okay. Sorry. Yeah. Oh, no, you're fine. And that was, like, besides those couple of seconds. So besides those couple of seconds. Hello? Yeah, yeah. I'm fine. Oh, yeah. So besides those couple of seconds when you're exposed to mustard gas, that was the one and only time when you're exposed? Or did you have to be exposed to it, like, once every month or once every year? I think maybe once every year. Yeah. I think maybe once every year because, oh, yeah, no, because you would have to get tested. You always have to do a PT test and a running test and you get a pass. So, or you get, you know, sent to recall, like, you got to go to training to make sure you pass it. So you always have to be in top shape, be in shape, working out, and running, always running. So, but, yeah. Yeah, so it's this one. No, I enjoyed it. I enjoyed it most of the time. You know, but it was easy. It was easy. It would just fall on in and just get, you know. So, yeah, I was in the car. Yeah. All right. Yeah. So what about any radiation, herbicides, or firefighting foam? No. No. And what about any toxins just to your MOS? Any toxins? No. No. And did you ever serve in the Southwest Asian Military Theater? Like Afghanistan, Iraq, Kuwait, anywhere over there? No. I did join during the time of war. No. I joined during the time of war. I joined during the time of war. I can't remember for that. Okay. I'm going to make it here. I know you say you're active duty and National Guard. What year did you enter active duty? What year did I enter active duty? Yes, sir. 2011. I mean, if you did two years. Oh, yeah, I'm going to say you did two years. 2011, yeah, because I signed up. I signed up in high school. You can sign up when you're, like, 17. But you weren't deployed. Like, you didn't go off to the military until 2012 or after high school? Yeah, yeah. I graduated in May. Now in 2012? Yeah. And. Okay. And, you know, yeah, I served up to 2013 until I got injured in the Guard. And then got discharged, like, two or three months after that. Okay. All right. So pretty much you entered in 2012. How long were you in active duty for? Like, what year did you end? What year did you? Was your last year of active duty? My last year of active duty? Mm-hmm. Was it 2014 or was it a little bit before then? Um. 2014. All right. When you were in National Guard, did you ever? Okay. So when you were in National Guard, did you ever go? Overseas? No. No, not overseas. When you were in National Guard, did you ever? Did you ever go into, like, active duty for, like, a couple weeks for training? Or was it just National Guard throughout the whole time? No, no. Only when I was in training was it active duty because I was in. After I finished, after I graduated basic, I went to, I went to, I graduated basic and then I went to AIT, and that's where I was, got certified in 91-Charlie, which was heater and AC, HVAC, heat and ventilation, and refrigeration. And, um. Okay. So you will say, um, so you will say that you were National Guard and active duty from 12 to 2014, even though you were in and out of active duty for, like, those two weeks as National Guard? Yeah. Or did you, uh, okay. So you will say 2012-2014, that's active duty. And then do you know, like, the year when you went into the National Guard? The year that I went into the National Guard? Yes, sir. Was 2011. What? So the way we consider it is that even though you signed up in 2011, you actually didn't go into the military until 2012. So that's the date that we're going to go off of because we can't use 2011 if you're in active duty. Oh, yeah, yeah. 2012. Okay. So you want to say 2012-2014 for National Guard and active duty? Yes. Even though you're, like, switching out? Okay. And you say you were never deployed for neither one of those. Let me go ahead and add those on there. No, no. I didn't even consider it. Okay. And then what's your, um, your, your, um, your gender and your race? Uh, male and, uh, black, African-American. Okay. And then what's your current height? Uh, five, six and a half. Or wait, no, no, no. Okay. And then what's your current? No, five-four. Five-four. I'm sorry. Okay. And then what's your, uh, what's your current weight? Uh, let's see. These, these, uh, 20, 210, 210 pounds. Okay. And then your best guess, what was your weight when you entered and left the military? When I entered or left the military, uh, uh, 180, 190. Okay. And you said you were about 190 when you left? Yeah. Okay. All right. And then were you ever treated, diagnosed, or do you feel like you suffer from a mental health condition such as PTSD, anxiety, insomnia, or depression? Anxiety, depression, yes. Okay. And then were you ever been, have you ever been diagnosed with a personality disorder or ever had any hair traumas while you were off-conscious in the military? I'm sorry, can you repeat that one? Yes. Did you ever have any hair traumas in the military where you lost conscience? Um, or did you ever, or have you ever diagnosed with a personality disorder? Um, does my aching count? Because I definitely was not, I don't have too much. Because occipital dislocation means my, my, my ligament was severed from my, my head was severed from my spine. So, my head came off, but it was, it was hanging by the skin. But it was announced that on the scene, and then, um, um, they had the emergency trauma surgery. And my, they were taking my spleen and my colon, well part of my colon, and, and, uh, small intestine, large intestine, uh, part of my liver. And so, it was just, uh, those are, yeah, those are, um, and, and, because I injured my abdomen, which has a C-belt too, so I had emergency trauma surgery and spinal fusion surgery. When I had the halo, they had to, um, put my, um, spinal, spinal, um, spine back together with the plates and screws and rods. And they took some bones from my hip and put it in my, uh, neck, uh, uh, to help with the injury and everything. And, um, um, yeah, yeah. Did you ever lose conscience? Yeah. Like, did you have any, like, exact head trauma? I was in a drug, I was in a drug, drug-induced trauma for a month, and then I woke up, uh, the next month I was in recovery, and then the third month I was in, uh, PT, DOT, and physiotherapy. And then, uh, for those, for those next two months, and, and then I, uh, went to the hospital at, uh, I don't even know what day it was. What day was that? Uh. Don't worry. Okay. And do you feel like, did you ever witness or experience any stressful events during active duty at all? Stressful events during active duty? Uh, basic training was stressful. Basic training, okay. And do you ever have flashbacks of bad things that happened during active duty? Flashback? Yeah, do you ever have any flashbacks of anything that happened during active duty? Yeah. Okay. Alright. And did you ever serve in a combat zone at all? No. Were you ever treated or diagnosed for a mental health condition on active duty? No. Okay. And then have you ever completed a sleep study before? No. Has someone ever told you that you snore, choke, or stop breathing while sleeping? Yeah. Alright. Do you feel like you still have difficulty falling asleep or staying asleep? Yeah. Alright. Have you ever taken any over-the-counter medications to help you sleep or been diagnosed with insomnia? Yeah. Okay. Alright. Did you get any headaches, asthma reflux, or any irritable bowels? Yeah. Okay. Did you ever talk to a doctor, a VA doctor, or your private doctor regarding your irritable bowels, asthma reflux, and headaches? Yeah. I take laxatives and blood pressure medicine and vitamins. I get a B12 shot. And I'm going to get my vaccines up to today. All that through the VA? All that through my primary care. And then I'm going to go to the VA. Again, Wednesday. And the Social Security office. But as far as right now, you just need your private doctor for those? Yeah. Okay. So, I'll put private doctor for headaches, asthma reflux, irritable bowels, and high blood pressure. What about any diabetes, ED, or vertigo? Vertigo, no. What about any diabetes or ED? ED. ED. Okay. And that was through your primary doctor as well? Yeah. Okay. And then what about any heart conditions? Or do you get any shaving bumps after you shave? Do I actually shave? Say that again? Yeah. Do you get any shaving bumps after you shave? Yeah. Okay. With the razor, though. I don't shave with razors, though. I use clippers. Okay. And you also brought that up to your medical provider also? Yeah. Okay. And do you have any scars on your head, neck, or face from active duty? Yeah, my neck from my injury. And my belly from my belly surgery. Oh, yeah. And do you have any dry eyes? Okay. And do you have any dry eyes? Dry eyes? Mm-hmm. No. Wait, yeah. I do have dry eyes. I have dry eyes. Yeah, it gets dry out here. It's the green A.V. out here. That's what my vision gets bad. Okay. All right. Primary doctor for those. All right. And I know you mentioned neck and your back the most. Do you have any shoulders, elbows, or wrist issues or pain? Yeah. Yeah. Okay. All right. So you say yes for shoulders, elbows, and wrist. And that's something that you brought to your private doctor as well? Yeah. Okay. Put that all in there. What about any hip, knees, ankles, or feet issues or pain? Pain? Yeah. I have pain with muscular atrophy. It makes me feel like I need to stretch, but it hurts to do it. It hurts my muscles out, so it's a lot of pain. Okay. You said, where was that at again? When I do my PT and OT, it's stretching my muscles, and it hurts the muscular dystrophy. It makes it hard. It makes your muscles stiff and it hurts. Oh, okay. It's a lot of pain. It's fucking terrible. It's a grown man cry. I believe it is. It fucking hurts. All right. Do it. Yeah. And what about any hip, knee, ankle, or feet issues? Yeah. Yes to all of those? Yeah. I have weak ankles. I have really weak ankles. I couldn't do my final ruck march because I was limping so bad. After the ruck march, because he marched about two miles, marched two miles. With a rucksack and a weapon and stuff like that. It wasn't that bad, but me after walking that far, I'm not able to do it. I'm limping. So I wasn't even really built for combat like that. Okay. And you said you've seen a doctor as well, your private doctor for your hips, knees, ankles, and feet also? Yeah. Okay. And what about any hearing loss or ringing in the ears? No, nothing like that. Okay. And what about do you go to the bathroom at least every two hours or twice a meal a night or have any loss of bladder control? I have no loss of bladder control. Yeah, no bladder control. I have a super pee catheter. Okay. It just drains my bladder. My bladder can't drain by itself and my bowels can't empty by themselves. They have to be initiated. I have to take enemas and stuff. Okay. It's a pile of stories. All right. Is that on there? Yeah. Okay. And then do you get any numbness, tingling, or nerve pain in your legs, your hips, or your butt sometimes? Numbness or tingling? Yeah. Okay. Okay. All right. And what about any radiating arm pain, numbness, or loss of sensation, or lack of motion in your neck or arms? Yeah. Okay. And that's something you also seem to hear you're treated for from your private doctor as well? Yeah. All right. And are there any conditions that you can't afford to go to the doctor Yeah. All right. And are there any conditions that you were seen for during active duty at all? Is there any conditions that I was seen for active duty? Anything that you went to medical or fit call for? I don't think anything medical because I literally only use my social security. I think if that counts towards it, I guess, I don't know. All I get is my medical, that $1,460. That's all you get a month. So I don't get no medical thing because I never listened to the VA like that. I never went to the hospital, filled out, signed up for, signed up for. Yeah. Okay. Yeah. So this is for like, this is just a general question. If you like, while you're in the military, like did you ever go to medical or fit call for anything during active duty? Oh, medical and fit call. Yeah. I went for the razor bumps. The razor bumps. And I went for... No, really it's just the razor bumps. The razor bumps. Okay. If anything does come up, like if you do remember anything else that you went to medical for during active duty, you can still let the nurse know. That will be the time to pretty much just get everything out because the more information you provide, the better that we can help fill up your medical information. So if you don't remember at all, that's fine. Give me a moment here. All right. So some things I'm just going to try to get you, we're basically going to go through a list of things we're going to try to get you benefits for. These things may change when you do talk to the nurse, but as far as right now, we're going to try to pursue for you mental health, sleep apnea, insomnia, lower and upper radiculopathy, dry eyes, headaches, GERD, irritable bowels, ED, hypertension, urination issues, neck, shoulders, elbows, wrists, back, hips, knees, ankles, feet, and shaving bumps. Is there anything that you don't want to go over or anything that we didn't get a chance to talk about that you'd like to talk more about with the nurse? No, there's nothing I want to talk to you about. It's Olympics and stuff. I'm like, what are these things? PTOT, physical therapy, and occupational therapy, and pool therapy. And the car accident that you mentioned. Okay. And the car accident that you mentioned that happened during National Guard, your car accident. Yeah, yeah, yeah. It was a little difficult. I was doing drills on the one to one, one to one, one to one, one to one, one to one, one to one. All right, so I also added in here the mustard gas training that you did once a year. For about a couple of seconds, I went ahead and added that on there as well. Is there anything else that we didn't get a chance to talk about that you'd like to add on here? Yeah, I'd like to add. Anything like respiratory, skin conditions, anything that you have any concerns about that you'd like to add on here? Oh, thank you. Thank you. Okay. Okay. And what's your current healthcare provider? Oh. Like my insurance or something? UnitedHealthcare. Perfect. All right, so I'm just going to go through a thing. Some additional offers, there's about nine of them. I'm just going to run through them, but anything that I mention, just stop me and let me know. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay.

All right. Yeah, so this is our main number. But, however, when you do talk with the nurses, they're probably going to be calling you off with like a different number. But this is our main line to get in contact with someone. Okay. What's the name of the service? All right, it's Trajector Medical. You're going to be getting some information from us in a little bit with our name up on there. So just give me one moment here. I'm going to send that to you. But what's your mailing address?

It's going to be coming from Adobe. It's going to say medical signature requested. And your password to get inside there is going to be your entire social without the dashes. But this is going to go over what's going to be expected of you in the next couple of days or in the next couple of moments. We're going to also, if you do have an extra hour of your time and a nurse is available, I'm going to go ahead and transfer you over. But if a nurse isn't available, I can go ahead and get you scheduled in for that. So if you have a nurse call, you're just going to go more into, like, your medical conditions, more things about what you experienced in the military, things like that, more information, the better. But also, too, I'm going to be also sending you a referral e-mail as well. So it is our mission. We do love helping out veterans. So if you do know of any loved ones or if you know of anybody, just let me know at the end so I can go ahead and add that information in here. But do you know of anybody else that we could potentially help? At the moment? No. I mean, only my family. My family members, my sister and my brother. My sister and my brother. Okay. And my oldest sister and my auntie. But they maybe don't say why. Okay. No worries. But, yeah, I'm going to be ‑‑ yes, I'll just send you some information.

This call may be recorded for quality assurance. If you wish to take the one-question survey at the end of this call, please stay on the line after. This call is being recorded. Hi. Thank you for calling Trajector Medical. This is Jessica. How can I help you? Hi. This is Michael, and I have Mr. Rashad on the line regarding their interest in VA disability benefits. Thank you, and both of you have a great day. All right. Hello. Can you hear me? Yeah, I can hear you. Hi. This is Jessica with Trajector Medical. Am I speaking with Rashad? Yes, this is him. All right. So, Rashad, let me inform you that this call is being recorded for quality and training purposes as well as compliance with the federal law. So, Rashad, you already talked with one of the representatives here, right, in Trajector, and you got disconnected from her? Yeah, I did. But, yeah, the other guy, he reconnected, and he said that I qualify. Okay. So, one moment. Let me just check if that representative is available now. Okay? Hold on. Okay. All right. All right. I'll be connecting you over now to that representative. Okay? Thank you. All right. Thank you. This call is being recorded. Up on the armrest, my left arm. Lift it up. Lift it on my elbow. What? Up on my left arm. Lift it up. I'm just kind of going to do this. All right. What is your name,'s name, please, and your email address, please? Lift it up. Lift it on my elbow. Put my elbow on. All right. Yeah, sorry about that. I'm here. Okay, no worries. Don't worry. So, yeah, before I get into that, I was District Attorney Gregory, correct? Yes, ma'am. Perfect. So before the phone went out, I was going to talk about our fees. So we do charge for our services, but it's only if we're able to help you get an increase. So if you get denied or you choose to cancel, there's no fee whatsoever. That's not up to you to start the process either. But let's just say you do get 10%. Our fee is five times whatever the VA grant you as a one-time fee at the end. But if you do get 10%, which is around $100 a month, our fee will be a one-time fee of $500. But let's just say if you do get around 40%, which is around $800 a month, it could be a one-time fee of $4,000. So it can be a lot higher or lower. It just depends on what the VA grant you. But we don't ask you to pay on that until you start getting paid from the VA. Okay. Okay? Okay. Do you have any questions on that at all? No, no. You want to go ahead and get started to see what we can do for you? Yeah. Okay. So also, too, at the end of this call, I'm going to be emailing you over an agreement to sign. Once we get that signed, since you never filed before, if there is a nurse available, we can go ahead and get you transferred over to the nurse. So you can go ahead and get that call out the way. After that nurse call, we'll go ahead and start developing the medical evidence packet for you, which can typically take about a week before it's ready to be submitted to the VA. So typically, you need that nurse call out the way. It does help with the process a lot faster. So just give me one moment here. Do you have, like, an honorable or an honorable discharge? Honorable discharge. Honorable medical discharge. Okay. Honorable medical. All right. So I'm just going to go through some qualifying questions first just to see if you qualify. Is your email address Rashad-Gregory47-yahoo.com? Yes, ma'am. Okay. And are you getting any VA attention at all? A pension? Yes. Are you getting a VA pension? No, I'm not getting anything. A VA pension? Okay. I'm getting disabilities. That's it. Okay. Perfect. Perfect. And the VA recognizes your first and last name as Rashad-Gregory? Yes. Rashad. Rashad. Oh, Rashad. Okay. Got you. Rashad. Rashad. Sorry. Rashad. It's like K-I-N-A-T-L. Rashad! They got your brother! That's me. That's me. I'm Rashad. Okay. What's your date of birth? My date of birth is February 16, 1994. 1994, February 16. Perfect. All right. And let's see here. All right. So, also, too, if we determine that we're able to assist you further, I will need to collect some personal information, such as your race and social security number. We only collect and process this information in order to provide our services to you. You can share information with anyone without your express consent to do so, and you can also access our privacy policy at trajector.com slash privacy.

Yes, if you're okay with that. Yeah, I'm okay. Okay. All right. And what state do you currently live in? Arizona. Okay. All right. And you're not currently getting any assistance at the moment? No. All right. And just let you know that we are not the VA, and we do not represent you on your claims, and we do not prepare your claims for the VA disability payments. Okay? Okay. Well, I get, like, the paperwork and stuff for it, so I need to prove it. Yes. That pretty much means that we're not the VA, and we're not lawyers or attorneys. We're just simply a third-party company who builds up that medical package for you, so you don't have to do that part, and all you do is submit it to the VA. Okay. Yes, sir. And do you have, like, a VA.gov or eBenefits account? I think I do, but I don't remember the info on it. I would have to double-check. Okay. I'm not sure. All right. No worries. If you haven't, you just might have to reset your password, because it is, like, a \\u2013 if you haven't logged in for a long time, it's had you do, like, some identity stuff. So no worries here. Have you ever filed before an open or pending claim? And when were you discharged from active duty? Let me see if I can get this. I joined \\u2013 I want to say 2014, 2015. Okay. What was the month? Your best guess is good, at least, or the season, if you're not sure. June. June 20, 2014. All right. June 20. And you did at least 90 days of active duty? What did you say? Did you do at least 90 days of active duty? Yeah. Okay. Perfect. And your \\u2013 it says active duty National Guard. And you say you're medically honorable. All right. And then what four-digit PIN code would you like to use to verify your identity? A thick one? Yes, like one \\u2013 because we're going to use this as your identification whenever we call you, for you to confirm. Okay. 9641. 9641. All right. So I already went over the different options that you can take to file disability benefits. So now we're going to go ahead and jump into the medical intake. All right. And what branch were you discharged from? Army National Guard. Army National Guard. All right. And what base were you discharged from? I have to look it up because they tell me if you get the name all the time. Hold on one second. Okay. Hold on one second. Okay. Sorry, it's taking me a minute. Hold on. Oh, no, you're fine. You're fine. I'm just getting some things done. But you're fine. Okay. And just let me know if you do need any help. I typically just put in, like, the branch and then, like, the city and the state, and then it typically will pop up for me. Just let me know if you need any help. Okay. Yeah, I need help. Okay. Yeah. Arizona, Phoenix, and what else did you need? What other places? So what pops up for me was Arizona National Guard, Pago Park, Phoenix MEPS. Yeah, that's correct. Phoenix MEPS. Yeah, Pago Park, yeah. Yeah, that's right. Oh, Pago. You said, so is the Arizona National Guard Pago Park? Yeah. Okay. One moment here. Let me get that in. All right. And did you ever see, like, a severance pay where they pay you to leave the military early? Yeah, they gave me a payment for staying in the hospital. They gave me a benefit because I was in the hospital for four months. So I had a benefit from that. I had a benefit from that. That sounds like medical benefits. Go ahead. Yeah, that was the medical benefits. Okay. So, yeah, so severance is, like, if there's, like, too many people in the military, they kind of pay you to kind of, like, leave a little bit early, and sometimes you end up having to pay back, like, later on in life. Oh, yeah. No, it wasn't like that. They was begging for me to do this. I never even, people, I never heard that. I never heard of too many people in the Army. You can't never have too big of an Army, just in case. Well, you want to have that Army. That's why we get to live with freedom. Right. Yeah, it's like a, yeah, the exact definition of it is, let me see here. One moment. So severance pay is pretty much to employees who are involuntarily separated from the federal services and meet specific eligibility requirements. So I believe, like, at one point they were paying people to, like, if you were to leave, you know, they'll pay you, like, a certain amount of money, but you end up having to pay back that money that they didn't tell a lot of military veterans about. So they start trying to file for disability benefits instead of paying that back. Also, I was told before that because I was in military service, that I have land somewhere, like, I own land somewhere. So that would be something you might have to ask specifically the VA about. Because, like, we just, honestly, we just help with getting veterans paid for their disabilities, and that's pretty much it. So definitely just reach out, because I'm just knowing that the VA.gov, that is a great resource for things that veterans are eligible for or that they can get assistance with. I would definitely say reach out to that website or just call the VA to see. That would be great if that was the case. Yeah, no, I'm going to the VA on Wednesday. So, yeah, no, I'm going to get that figured out. Okay, yeah, for sure, definitely. All righty. So those separate there. And then what conditions do you have that you're looking to get benefits for? What conditions? Yes. Incomplete quadriplegia. That's the name of the diagnosis. Incomplete quadriplegia. Incomplete quad. Incomplete quadriplegia. And the injury I suffered was called occipital dislocation. And I fractured my top three vertebrae in my spine, my C1 to C3. Okay, and that was their national guard? Yes. With your back? Okay. And the incomplete quadriplegia, is that in your back as well? Yeah, it's in my back already. Is that in your back, like where that area is? Is that in your back or just a body part? My neck, it's my neck. Oh, it's your neck. So let me put your neck on here. Did that happen also during active duty? I mean during national guard? No, no, it was off duty. It was off duty. It wasn't active duty. Okay, off duty. Okay, so I'm putting here your neck and your back. All right, I'm going to make sure. Thank you. You're welcome. All right, you're a first-time client with us. Will you refer to us by any chance? Yes. Okay, what was the name? I just found you online. Oh, online, okay. All right, let's see here. And are you currently in any trade school? No, I am about to start training for the Special Olympics, though. Okay, awesome. Sounds like it's going to be fun. Are you currently employed and working? I am, like, I do sit-down comedy also for Handicapable, representing the Handicapable because I'm an advocate, I'm a disability advocate, so I'm going to start a podcast, too. I also do open-mic comedy stand-up skits and crowd work and stuff like that. Okay. Is that something that you do, like, that you're trying to get paid under the table for, or is that, like, you're currently, like, employed, like, taxable? I haven't made any profit from it yet. I've literally only done one open mic so far. But I have. Okay. It is with talent agencies with modeling and acting and voice acting. Okay. So you would consider that as being employed, or is that something like kind of like a? Oh, I don't make any money from it right now. I'm just trying to. But you are legally employed doing that? No, I'm not. I'm not under contract or nothing. Oh, okay, gotcha. So I just. Yeah, I'm still auditioning and shit. Sorry. Gotcha, gotcha. Okay, so I'll just say, so I'll just say no as far as currently employed and working, because pretty much that question means, like, you're employed to a company and making, like, a salary. Yeah, I'm still training. Like, I'm about to start training. Like, I'm not even in training yet. I'm about to start training. Hey, I got to go to the doctor's appointment with my primary care today to get checked up and make sure I'm good to make sure I can do it. Then I'm going to go to VA Wednesday. We'll see what the benefits there. Then I got to go to Social Security. Yeah, I got a bunch of shit to do. You know what I mean? But, yeah, no, this is just the start of it, though. But I don't have a job. I haven't worked in over a decade. Okay, okay. Do you feel like you're unable to work, or do you feel like you're work restricted due to your disabilities? Yeah, my disability, because, well, one, I couldn't do the things I wanted to do because I had two disabilities at first. Because spinal cord injury is a deteriorating condition. So you deteriorate, your body deteriorates at an accelerated rate. But it's not, like, you know, it's like you're getting older faster, basically, in a nutshell. Like your body's older, but you're young. Like I'm only 30, but, you know, I live like, you know, I'm 60. Or not even 60, like 92. Gotcha. But, you know, I got mistaken for somebody's granddaddy twice. And the person I was with, they thought my older brother was my son. I was like, nah, nah, something got to give. Something got to give now. Something got to give. That's why I need to make a change. I had my beard out and everything. I was like, yeah, I look older. I was like, now I look 22. That's what I was told. So I look younger without the beard. So I was like, yeah. But I miss my beard, though. I do like the beard. Anyway, I'm rambling. You're fine, you're fine. I want to say, yeah, the beard definitely makes anyone look older and mature. Yeah, yeah. Thank you. Okay. I can grow my hair out. I know I heard you. What was that? I'm going to wait until playoffs. When I start playing. I'm going to do wheelchair football. Okay. So. Okay. Yeah, they have special Olympics wheelchair football. I'm going to go for gold in that. A couple gold medals. Okay, okay. That's cool. Definitely, definitely stay active for sure. I know you said you haven't worked at all in the last ten years. And I know you had mentioned something about the VA. So typically you can still go through. You can work with different companies as far as if it's like a free company like the VA. It's just that if you do end up going through the VA on things that we can't help you with, you can definitely do that. But it's just that you can't work with two different companies for the same conditions. So I just do want to go ahead and let you know that for sure. But you can definitely go through the VA for like, I know we don't really touch on eyes or eyes or like dental. But I do know the VA, if you have any conditions with those or anything like that, they can definitely help you with that also. Okay. Okay. All right. And then what was your MOS in the military? My MOS in the military was 91 Charlie. 91 Charlie. Never going to forget that, bro. That was a dream right there for a second. Not my plan, right? Yep. God's plan. And then what was your, did you do any like parachute jumps at all? No, I was an Army Ranger. I was an Army Ranger. So I thought about it before I was going to do it, because I was going to go active. But then I got in, you know, I got my parachute. Okay. And then are you currently getting any medical retirement pay or any military retirement pay? Medical retirement pay? No, no. I haven't even worked on my retirement yet. Okay. And then were you ever exposed in the military? Were you ever exposed to any Agent Orange, Contaminated Orange, Camp Lejeune, asbestos, or any mustard gas? Yeah, mustard gas. In training, yeah, they used mustard gas. Okay. And that was at, let me see here. That was at the Aragon National Guard base, or was it? No, that was the basic training at Fort Lee, Fort Lee in South Carolina. Fort Lee, L-E-E? Yes. Okay. And your best guess, even though I know it was probably a couple of weeks, what year did you enter the military, to where you were in basic training for that? What year did I enter? I signed up 2012, or before 2012. I signed up in 2011. Yeah, so I signed up in 2011 and got into 2012. So, yeah, that's what it was. I served two and a half years. So I signed, yeah. I signed in 2011. And in 2013 I got in. So I probably got discharged in 2013, too. But it wasn't June 28th. It was like, I don't know, maybe like two or three months after that. All right. So the mustard gas, were you exposed to like any tear gas? Was that like the mustard gas, or was the mustard gas something different? The mustard gas. No, the mustard gas was just basic training. Okay. So you went in, like, because we do have to get, because we ask these days to see, like, the longevity of when you were exposed to those chemicals. So it doesn't have to be, like, spot on. But do you know, like, a month in the year when you're exposed to the mustard gas? Oh, within a month of the year? Like after, or have I been exposed to it? Yeah, like the month in the year when you entered exposure and when you left exposure. So I guess when you got into basic training and then when you left basic training. Or what those dates. That was in 2012. 2012. 2012. Do you know what month that was in 2012? Like it was, like, what season? July. Oh, July of 2012. Or gas or something like that. And then do you know how long you were exposed to the mustard gas? A couple of weeks. No, no, no. It was, like, a couple of seconds. Yeah, like two, three seconds. Oh, okay. So it was just, okay. Okay. So I'm going to add that note on here. I'm just not going to mark it since you were only exposed to it for a couple of seconds. But I am going to add it on here as a note that we kind of talk about that a little bit more with the nurse to see if there's any possible respiratory pains or anything like that. Okay. But when everybody gets mustard gas, like, it's a basic training thing. It's a part of the test. I mean, it's part of the training. Training course. You know what I'm saying? Yeah, but, okay, yeah, if you have to take a note of it, you can take a note of it. Okay. Sorry. Yeah. Oh, no, you're fine. And that was, like, besides those couple of seconds. So besides those couple of seconds. Hello? Yeah, yeah. I'm fine. Oh, yeah. So besides those couple of seconds when you're exposed to mustard gas, that was the one and only time when you're exposed? Or did you have to be exposed to it, like, once every month or once every year? I think maybe once every year. Yeah. I think maybe once every year because, oh, yeah, no, because you would have to get tested. You always have to do a PT test and a running test and you get a pass. So, or you get, you know, sent to recall, like, you got to go to training to make sure you pass it. So you always have to be in top shape, be in shape, working out, and running, always running. So, but, yeah. Yeah, so it's this one. No, I enjoyed it. I enjoyed it most of the time. You know, but it was easy. It was easy. It would just fall on in and just get, you know. So, yeah, I was in the car. Yeah. All right. Yeah. So what about any radiation, herbicides, or firefighting foam? No. No. And what about any toxins just to your MOS? Any toxins? No. No. And did you ever serve in the Southwest Asian Military Theater? Like Afghanistan, Iraq, Kuwait, anywhere over there? No. I did join during the time of war. No. I joined during the time of war. I joined during the time of war. I can't remember for that. Okay. I'm going to make it here. I know you say you're active duty and National Guard. What year did you enter active duty? What year did I enter active duty? Yes, sir. 2011. I mean, if you did two years. Oh, yeah, I'm going to say you did two years. 2011, yeah, because I signed up. I signed up in high school. You can sign up when you're, like, 17. But you weren't deployed. Like, you didn't go off to the military until 2012 or after high school? Yeah, yeah. I graduated in May. Now in 2012? Yeah. And. Okay. And, you know, yeah, I served up to 2013 until I got injured in the Guard. And then got discharged, like, two or three months after that. Okay. All right. So pretty much you entered in 2012. How long were you in active duty for? Like, what year did you end? What year did you? Was your last year of active duty? My last year of active duty? Mm-hmm. Was it 2014 or was it a little bit before then? Um. 2014. All right. When you were in National Guard, did you ever? Okay. So when you were in National Guard, did you ever go? Overseas? No. No, not overseas. When you were in National Guard, did you ever? Did you ever go into, like, active duty for, like, a couple weeks for training? Or was it just National Guard throughout the whole time? No, no. Only when I was in training was it active duty because I was in. After I finished, after I graduated basic, I went to, I went to, I graduated basic and then I went to AIT, and that's where I was, got certified in 91-Charlie, which was heater and AC, HVAC, heat and ventilation, and refrigeration. And, um. Okay. So you will say, um, so you will say that you were National Guard and active duty from 12 to 2014, even though you were in and out of active duty for, like, those two weeks as National Guard? Yeah. Or did you, uh, okay. So you will say 2012-2014, that's active duty. And then do you know, like, the year when you went into the National Guard? The year that I went into the National Guard? Yes, sir. Was 2011. What? So the way we consider it is that even though you signed up in 2011, you actually didn't go into the military until 2012. So that's the date that we're going to go off of because we can't use 2011 if you're in active duty. Oh, yeah, yeah. 2012. Okay. So you want to say 2012-2014 for National Guard and active duty? Yes. Even though you're, like, switching out? Okay. And you say you were never deployed for neither one of those. Let me go ahead and add those on there. No, no. I didn't even consider it. Okay. And then what's your, um, your, your, um, your gender and your race? Uh, male and, uh, black, African-American. Okay. And then what's your current height? Uh, five, six and a half. Or wait, no, no, no. Okay. And then what's your current? No, five-four. Five-four. I'm sorry. Okay. And then what's your, uh, what's your current weight? Uh, let's see. These, these, uh, 20, 210, 210 pounds. Okay. And then your best guess, what was your weight when you entered and left the military? When I entered or left the military, uh, uh, 180, 190. Okay. And you said you were about 190 when you left? Yeah. Okay. All right. And then were you ever treated, diagnosed, or do you feel like you suffer from a mental health condition such as PTSD, anxiety, insomnia, or depression? Anxiety, depression, yes. Okay. And then were you ever been, have you ever been diagnosed with a personality disorder or ever had any hair traumas while you were off-conscious in the military? I'm sorry, can you repeat that one? Yes. Did you ever have any hair traumas in the military where you lost conscience? Um, or did you ever, or have you ever diagnosed with a personality disorder? Um, does my aching count? Because I definitely was not, I don't have too much. Because occipital dislocation means my, my, my ligament was severed from my, my head was severed from my spine. So, my head came off, but it was, it was hanging by the skin. But it was announced that on the scene, and then, um, um, they had the emergency trauma surgery. And my, they were taking my spleen and my colon, well part of my colon, and, and, uh, small intestine, large intestine, uh, part of my liver. And so, it was just, uh, those are, yeah, those are, um, and, and, because I injured my abdomen, which has a C-belt too, so I had emergency trauma surgery and spinal fusion surgery. When I had the halo, they had to, um, put my, um, spinal, spinal, um, spine back together with the plates and screws and rods. And they took some bones from my hip and put it in my, uh, neck, uh, uh, to help with the injury and everything. And, um, um, yeah, yeah. Did you ever lose conscience? Yeah. Like, did you have any, like, exact head trauma? I was in a drug, I was in a drug, drug-induced trauma for a month, and then I woke up, uh, the next month I was in recovery, and then the third month I was in, uh, PT, DOT, and physiotherapy. And then, uh, for those, for those next two months, and, and then I, uh, went to the hospital at, uh, I don't even know what day it was. What day was that? Uh. Don't worry. Okay. And do you feel like, did you ever witness or experience any stressful events during active duty at all? Stressful events during active duty? Uh, basic training was stressful. Basic training, okay. And do you ever have flashbacks of bad things that happened during active duty? Flashback? Yeah, do you ever have any flashbacks of anything that happened during active duty? Yeah. Okay. Alright. And did you ever serve in a combat zone at all? No. Were you ever treated or diagnosed for a mental health condition on active duty? No. Okay. And then have you ever completed a sleep study before? No. Has someone ever told you that you snore, choke, or stop breathing while sleeping? Yeah. Alright. Do you feel like you still have difficulty falling asleep or staying asleep? Yeah. Alright. Have you ever taken any over-the-counter medications to help you sleep or been diagnosed with insomnia? Yeah. Okay. Alright. Did you get any headaches, asthma reflux, or any irritable bowels? Yeah. Okay. Did you ever talk to a doctor, a VA doctor, or your private doctor regarding your irritable bowels, asthma reflux, and headaches? Yeah. I take laxatives and blood pressure medicine and vitamins. I get a B12 shot. And I'm going to get my vaccines up to today. All that through the VA? All that through my primary care. And then I'm going to go to the VA. Again, Wednesday. And the Social Security office. But as far as right now, you just need your private doctor for those? Yeah. Okay. So, I'll put private doctor for headaches, asthma reflux, irritable bowels, and high blood pressure. What about any diabetes, ED, or vertigo? Vertigo, no. What about any diabetes or ED? ED. ED. Okay. And that was through your primary doctor as well? Yeah. Okay. And then what about any heart conditions? Or do you get any shaving bumps after you shave? Do I actually shave? Say that again? Yeah. Do you get any shaving bumps after you shave? Yeah. Okay. With the razor, though. I don't shave with razors, though. I use clippers. Okay. And you also brought that up to your medical provider also? Yeah. Okay. And do you have any scars on your head, neck, or face from active duty? Yeah, my neck from my injury. And my belly from my belly surgery. Oh, yeah. And do you have any dry eyes? Okay. And do you have any dry eyes? Dry eyes? Mm-hmm. No. Wait, yeah. I do have dry eyes. I have dry eyes. Yeah, it gets dry out here. It's the green A.V. out here. That's what my vision gets bad. Okay. All right. Primary doctor for those. All right. And I know you mentioned neck and your back the most. Do you have any shoulders, elbows, or wrist issues or pain? Yeah. Yeah. Okay. All right. So you say yes for shoulders, elbows, and wrist. And that's something that you brought to your private doctor as well? Yeah. Okay. Put that all in there. What about any hip, knees, ankles, or feet issues or pain? Pain? Yeah. I have pain with muscular atrophy. It makes me feel like I need to stretch, but it hurts to do it. It hurts my muscles out, so it's a lot of pain. Okay. You said, where was that at again? When I do my PT and OT, it's stretching my muscles, and it hurts the muscular dystrophy. It makes it hard. It makes your muscles stiff and it hurts. Oh, okay. It's a lot of pain. It's fucking terrible. It's a grown man cry. I believe it is. It fucking hurts. All right. Do it. Yeah. And what about any hip, knee, ankle, or feet issues? Yeah. Yes to all of those? Yeah. I have weak ankles. I have really weak ankles. I couldn't do my final ruck march because I was limping so bad. After the ruck march, because he marched about two miles, marched two miles. With a rucksack and a weapon and stuff like that. It wasn't that bad, but me after walking that far, I'm not able to do it. I'm limping. So I wasn't even really built for combat like that. Okay. And you said you've seen a doctor as well, your private doctor for your hips, knees, ankles, and feet also? Yeah. Okay. And what about any hearing loss or ringing in the ears? No, nothing like that. Okay. And what about do you go to the bathroom at least every two hours or twice a meal a night or have any loss of bladder control? I have no loss of bladder control. Yeah, no bladder control. I have a super pee catheter. Okay. It just drains my bladder. My bladder can't drain by itself and my bowels can't empty by themselves. They have to be initiated. I have to take enemas and stuff. Okay. It's a pile of stories. All right. Is that on there? Yeah. Okay. And then do you get any numbness, tingling, or nerve pain in your legs, your hips, or your butt sometimes? Numbness or tingling? Yeah. Okay. Okay. All right. And what about any radiating arm pain, numbness, or loss of sensation, or lack of motion in your neck or arms? Yeah. Okay. And that's something you also seem to hear you're treated for from your private doctor as well? Yeah. All right. And are there any conditions that you can't afford to go to the doctor Yeah. All right. And are there any conditions that you were seen for during active duty at all? Is there any conditions that I was seen for active duty? Anything that you went to medical or fit call for? I don't think anything medical because I literally only use my social security. I think if that counts towards it, I guess, I don't know. All I get is my medical, that $1,460. That's all you get a month. So I don't get no medical thing because I never listened to the VA like that. I never went to the hospital, filled out, signed up for, signed up for. Yeah. Okay. Yeah. So this is for like, this is just a general question. If you like, while you're in the military, like did you ever go to medical or fit call for anything during active duty? Oh, medical and fit call. Yeah. I went for the razor bumps. The razor bumps. And I went for... No, really it's just the razor bumps. The razor bumps. Okay. If anything does come up, like if you do remember anything else that you went to medical for during active duty, you can still let the nurse know. That will be the time to pretty much just get everything out because the more information you provide, the better that we can help fill up your medical information. So if you don't remember at all, that's fine. Give me a moment here. All right. So some things I'm just going to try to get you, we're basically going to go through a list of things we're going to try to get you benefits for. These things may change when you do talk to the nurse, but as far as right now, we're going to try to pursue for you mental health, sleep apnea, insomnia, lower and upper radiculopathy, dry eyes, headaches, GERD, irritable bowels, ED, hypertension, urination issues, neck, shoulders, elbows, wrists, back, hips, knees, ankles, feet, and shaving bumps. Is there anything that you don't want to go over or anything that we didn't get a chance to talk about that you'd like to talk more about with the nurse? No, there's nothing I want to talk to you about. It's Olympics and stuff. I'm like, what are these things? PTOT, physical therapy, and occupational therapy, and pool therapy. And the car accident that you mentioned. Okay. And the car accident that you mentioned that happened during National Guard, your car accident. Yeah, yeah, yeah. It was a little difficult. I was doing drills on the one to one, one to one, one to one, one to one, one to one, one to one. All right, so I also added in here the mustard gas training that you did once a year. For about a couple of seconds, I went ahead and added that on there as well. Is there anything else that we didn't get a chance to talk about that you'd like to add on here? Yeah, I'd like to add. Anything like respiratory, skin conditions, anything that you have any concerns about that you'd like to add on here? Oh, thank you. Thank you. Okay. Okay. And what's your current healthcare provider? Oh. Like my insurance or something? UnitedHealthcare. Perfect. All right, so I'm just going to go through a thing. Some additional offers, there's about nine of them. I'm just going to run through them, but anything that I mention, just stop me and let me know. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. All right. And also, too, like if we ever do need to call you in the future, what's a good day and time for us to give you a call? Yeah. Anytime? Anytime. Okay. All right. Yeah, so this is our main number. But, however, when you do talk with the nurses, they're probably going to be calling you off with like a different number. But this is our main line to get in contact with someone. Okay. What's the name of the service? All right, it's Trajector Medical. You're going to be getting some information from us in a little bit with our name up on there. So just give me one moment here. I'm going to send that to you. But what's your mailing address? Oh, 15402 North Central Avenue. And, yeah, North Central Avenue. Phoenix, Arizona. Phoenix, Arizona. 85022. All right. And you said 85022? Yes. Okay. One moment here. All right. So that's 15402 North Central Avenue, Phoenix, Arizona, 85022. Okay. And what's your full social? 6-0-1. Hold on. 6-0-1-3-9. 6-0-1-3-9-4-2-6-6. 6-0-1-3-9-4-2-6-6. Yeah. Oh, my God. I just have to have somebody grab it for me. Okay. No worries. Yeah, I do want to make sure that it is correct because after this, I'm going to be sending you the agreement. And, like, your name and your social security number is, like, the main thing. And your date of birth is, like, the main thing you have to have correct. Anything else we can change, like, your address and your phone number. But just let me know once you have it so we can just make sure this is the correct one, okay? You got to grab my wallet. Go for it. Okay. No worries. Hey, Mika. Can you grab my wallet for me? Okay. What? Oh. Yeah, my ID and my social security card. What's wrong with your social security card? Right behind it.

Okay, perfect, perfect. Six, six. Okay, perfect. All right, so if you can go ahead and open up your e-mail address, whether you do it on your phone or another device, I went ahead and e-mailed you over the agreement. It's going to be coming from Adobe. It's going to say medical signature requested. And your password to get inside there is going to be your entire social without the dashes. But this is going to go over what's going to be expected of you in the next couple of days or in the next couple of moments. We're going to also, if you do have an extra hour of your time and a nurse is available, I'm going to go ahead and transfer you over. But if a nurse isn't available, I can go ahead and get you scheduled in for that. So if you have a nurse call, you're just going to go more into, like, your medical conditions, more things about what you experienced in the military, things like that, more information, the better. But also, too, I'm going to be also sending you a referral e-mail as well. So it is our mission. We do love helping out veterans.

That way, if you do come across anyone, you can just let them know. But other than that, once you see the \\u2011\\u2011 you're going to be signing in two places on the agreement. At the bottom, once you see that you're all set, just let me know so I can see if you have any nurses available to go ahead and get you transferred over, okay? Okay. All right. So just let me know if you need any questions. Again, the password is going to be your social security number without the dashes to log in, okay? All right. Okay. Perfect. I don't know why. How many people in the audience? Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay.
